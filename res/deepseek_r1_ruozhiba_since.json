(1) **Equivocation**: The term 'atomic' is misused ambiguously, conflating the scientific concept of atoms (size) with the destructive mechanism of nuclear fission (energy release). (2) **False Premise**: The claim that atomic bombs are 'as small as atoms' and 'cannot be seen' is factually incorrect (atomic bombs are macroscopic devices). (3) **False Analogy**: The assumption that physical size directly correlates with destructive power ignores the unique physics of nuclear weapons (e.g., a small nuclear device can dwarf conventional bombs in energy output). These fallacies invalidate the conclusion that atomic bombs 'do not do any damage.'"
