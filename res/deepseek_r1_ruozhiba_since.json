        "details": "The argument commits a **false analogy** by comparing gold mined to Olympic pools and then illogically linking lifeguards (associated with pools) to gold quantity. It assumes a causal relationship between lifeguards and gold (**false cause**), despite no evidence connecting the two. Further, the premise that 'gold changes with lifeguards' is entirely unfounded (**false premise**), as there is no rational basis for this claim."

        "details": "The argument commits a **false analogy** by equating power plants to 'large pots for growing electricity,' implying they function like literal plants, which is a flawed comparison. It also exhibits a **nominal fallacy** by interpreting the metaphorical term 'planting' power plants as a literal act of gardening, leading to the nonsensical conclusion that electricity 'sprouts' like flowers. Additionally, **equivocation** occurs in the misuse of 'plant' (industrial facility vs. botanical object) to create ambiguity."

        "details": "The argument commits a nominal fallacy by interpreting 'shelf-life' literally (as requiring placement on a physical shelf) rather than recognizing it as a metaphorical term for expiration timelines regardless of storage location. It also relies on a false premise: shelf-life is determined by factors like microbial growth or chemical degradation, not physical proximity to a shelf. The equivocation arises from conflating the literal meaning of 'shelf' with the technical concept of 'shelf-life,' leading to an invalid conclusion that food on the floor cannot expire."

        "details": "The argument contains a false premise: it assumes a physical coin is required to calculate the probability of wasting time by flipping it, even though the time-consumption is a practical concern, not a probabilistic outcome dependent on the coin itself. This conflates theoretical probability (which does not require physical execution) with practical time expenditure. Equivocation arises if 'using a coin' ambiguously refers to both theoretical probability models and physical actions. False cause is present if the argument incorrectly links the coin (a tool for probability) to the unrelated effect (time wasted), implying a causal relationship where none exists."

This misuse of 'someone' involves **equivocation**, as the term is ambiguously shifted from its conventional meaning. Additionally, the conclusion (immortality) is derived by circularly assuming the premises (e.g., 'mortals die from one shot') are universally absolute, which **begs the question** by framing survival as proof of immortality rather than questioning the flawed premises themselves."
