This is an instance of equivocation, where the multiple meanings of '-' lead to an ambiguous interpretation. The false premise here is the incorrect assumption that the instructions indicate a negative baking time based on mathematical subtraction. Additionally, misunderstanding the metaphorical or context-specific usage of the symbol in the pizza instructions as a literal math operation aligns with a nominal fallacy. Therefore, interpreting the baking time as -3 minutes is logically flawed."

        "details": "The sentence exhibits a logic error known as 'begging the question', as it uses the statement that '4/3 of Americans have trouble with fractions' both as a premise and a conclusion without external evidence. The premise itself is a false premise because the fraction 4/3 does not logically translate to a proportion of people and is nonsensical, which also hints at the nominal fallacy where a metaphorical expression is trusted as literal. The reasoning is flawed as it relies on a self-referential and circular logic without valid justification."

        "details": "The sentence demonstrates a logic error. First, it applies the nominal fallacy by taking the idiomatic expression 'shoot the breeze' literally. This expression is figurative and is not meant to be interpreted as literally shooting the wind with a gun. Second, there is equivocation present since the phrase 'shoot the breeze' is being interpreted in multiple contexts (figurative and literal) leading to a misleading conclusion that the wind will actually suffer. These fallacies cause a misunderstanding of the intended meaning of the idiomatic expression."

        "details": "The argument is based on the false premise that identifying a problem after it occurs inherently means one is more skilled than those who did not foresee it. This overlooks the complexity of the situation and the historical context. It also employs a false cause fallacy by assuming that the ability to identify issues post-event is directly correlated with skill or knowledge, neglecting other factors like hindsight bias. Additionally, it misinterprets the nature of expertise, which is assessed through professional context and standards of the time, rather than modern observation, making it a nominal fallacy."

        "details": "The sentence uses equivocation by employing the word 'dead' ambiguously, referring to both languages that are no longer spoken and deceased persons. It creates confusion between these meanings. Additionally, there is a false premise in assuming that 'dead language' means the language of the dead (as people), which is not valid. Moreover, interpreting 'dead language' literally to mean it allows communication with the dead is a nominal fallacy because 'dead language' is a metaphorical term for languages that are no longer in use."

The assumption that the total amount of gold is solely determined by pool size is a false premise. Additionally, the improper distribution or addition fallacy is present because it suggests that simply increasing the size of the pool would result in more gold, ignoring the actual complexities of determining gold volumes."

Begging the question is present because it assumes what it is trying to prove, that power plants can generate electricity entirely independently. A false cause fallacy appears in the assumption that simply building more power plants would directly solve the energy crisis, without considering the complexities of energy production and resource availability."

This is a nominal fallacy because it misinterprets a metaphorical expression ('shelf-life' as referring specifically to food placed on shelves) as literal. Additionally, the conclusion is based on a false premise that food's expiration is dependent solely on it being on a shelf. There's also equivocation in the term 'shelf-life,' which is used with its metaphorical meaning (the duration before expiration) but interpreted literally in the reasoning."

Additionally, 'false cause' is implied, as the need for a coin to evaluate the probability of wasting time is not causally related to the coin's function of calculating probabilities; rather, the premise assumes a connection that does not necessarily exist. Wasting time is a subjective perception and not inherently linked to the probabilistic function of the coin."

Additionally, there is an equivocation of the word 'someone,' which is typically understood to mean any individual rather than the same person repeatedly. The assumption that this person must be immortal due to surviving multiple shootings is a nominal fallacy, as it misconstrues the metaphorical or figurative use of 'someone' to make a literal conclusion that lacks foundation."
