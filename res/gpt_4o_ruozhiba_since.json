The fallacy misuses the meaning of 'extra' to incorrectly conclude that overpopulation would imply the presence of extraterrestrials on Earth. Additionally, the premise that 'extra-terrestrial' does not have a special meaning is a false premise, as it is a well-established term meaning beings or objects from outside Earth.

This is a flawed analogy because 'salmonella' in chicken and the word 'salmon' are unrelated in terms of the biological relationship that causes foodborne illness. The argument also contains a false premise by suggesting that salmonella is a byproduct of salmon, which is incorrect, as salmonella is not naturally associated with salmon. Lastly, there is a nominal fallacy in assuming that the similarity in the words 'salmonella' and 'salmon' implies they are biologically related, leading to a misunderstanding of the intended meaning of 'salmonella'."

The main issue is equivocation, as 'light years' is being used ambiguously\u2014both as a measure of distance and as a unit of weight. This creates confusion. Additionally, the comparison between 'light objects' and 'light-years' assumes a false analogy between physical properties of objects and abstract measures of distance. Finally, there is a nominal fallacy in the assumption that a 'light-year' (a unit of distance) could be compared to a 'leap year' (a unit of time), treating them as if they could be meaningfully contrasted in terms of physical properties."

The comparison between 'houses' for snails and the human concept of housing is not valid. Additionally, it assumes causality in an unsupported way ('housing crisis causes people to lose houses' leading to 'slugs are snails affected by the housing crisis'). This is a false cause fallacy because it assumes that slugs, which are simply snails without shells, are metaphorically affected by a housing crisis, while failing to demonstrate any real causal relationship. Finally, it borders on begging the question by assuming that slugs, being snails without shells, are part of the 'housing crisis' analogy without establishing why this is the case."
