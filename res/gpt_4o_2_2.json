Improper distribution or addition occurs when the rule is applied universally to all actions without considering proportionality or context (e.g., turning pages quietly doesn't necessarily break the spirit of a silence rule)."

    "details": "The sentence commits a false analogy by assuming that the process of planting seeds and the result of having multiple plants is directly analogous to organizing those plants into a sustainable food source. The idea that 1000 individual plants automatically organize into a sustainable food source overlooks factors like resource management, plant care, and environmental conditions, which are necessary for sustainability. Additionally, the argument contains a fallacy of composition, as it assumes that because individual plants may succeed in producing food, a group of plants will automatically lead to a sustainable food source. Finally, there's a false cause fallacy, where it is implied that simply planting 1000 seeds will result in a sustainable food source, ignoring other necessary causal factors."

    "details": "The statement assumes that solving 200 practice problems directly equates to complete exam readiness, without accounting for the quality or depth of understanding. The fallacy of 'false cause' is evident as it suggests a simple correlation between solving problems and readiness without establishing causation. It also commits a 'wrong direction' error by implying that understanding 200 concepts automatically guarantees readiness, which may not be the case. Additionally, there's a 'false analogy' in comparing the accumulation of problems to a holistic understanding of concepts."
