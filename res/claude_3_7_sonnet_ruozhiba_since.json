The primary error is a Nominal Fallacy, as it takes John Cena's catchphrase 'You can't see me' (which is figurative speech meant as a taunt) and treats it as a literal statement about invisibility. This then leads to a False Premise that John Cena is actually invisible, which becomes the foundation for the subsequent fallacious reasoning about camo making him visible. There's also Equivocation at play, as the meaning of 'can't see' shifts between its metaphorical usage in the catchphrase and a literal interpretation about visibility. The entire argument rests on these misinterpretations of figurative language as literal statements."

        "details": "This statement contains multiple logical errors. First, it relies on a False Premise that spotting flaws in hindsight (with all the available information after an event) demonstrates greater skill than designing something without that foreknowledge. Second, it establishes a False Cause relationship by assuming that being able to identify problems after they've occurred proves superior knowledge compared to those working with limited information beforehand. Third, it commits the Fallacy of composition by generalizing that because the person can identify one aspect (design flaws) after the fact, they must be more skilled in all aspects of engineering. The statement ignores historical context, the limitations of knowledge at the time, and the advantage of hindsight in problem identification."

        "sentence": "Since \u201cdead\u201d means death and also disappearance, and 'dead language' means the language of the disappeared but it can also be the language of the dead, therefore speaking a dead language allows you to talk to the dead.",

        "logic_fallacies": "Equivocation, False Premise, Nominal Fallacy",
        "details": "This reasoning contains multiple logical errors, primarily equivocation. The argument exploits the ambiguity in the word 'dead' by shifting between different meanings. In 'dead language,' the term 'dead' metaphorically refers to languages no longer in everyday use, not literally languages spoken by deceased people. The argument then incorrectly concludes that speaking such a language enables communication with deceased individuals. This is also a nominal fallacy, as it takes the figurative expression 'dead language' and interprets it literally. Additionally, it builds on the false premise that a language no longer in common use somehow maintains a connection to deceased individuals who may have once spoken it. These fallacies combine to create an illogical conclusion."

        "sentence": "Since the amount of gold that humans have mined throughout history can be analogised to 3.42 olympic pools, and the total amount of gold is determined solely by the size of the pool without considering any other factors such as the density of gold, historical mining data, or geological availability, therefore the bigger the pool the more gold.",
        "logic_error": "yes",
        "logic_fallacies": "False Cause, False Analogy, False Premise",
        "details": "This sentence contains multiple logical errors. First, it makes a False Analogy by claiming that gold quantity can be simplistically compared to pool sizes without accounting for critical factors. The analogy is misleading because it incorrectly implies that the relationship between gold amount and pool size is direct and complete. Second, there's Improper Distribution/Addition by assuming that the scaling relationship between pools and gold is linear (bigger pool = more gold), which fails to consider how real-world quantities work. Third, it contains a False Premise by asserting that 'the total amount of gold is determined solely by the size of the pool' - this is fundamentally incorrect as gold quantity depends on geological factors, not arbitrary containers. The conclusion drawn ('the bigger the pool the more gold') misuses the initial analogy to make an unfounded causal claim."

        "details": "This sentence contains several logical errors. The primary fallacy is a False Premise, as it incorrectly states that 'power plants generate electricity without any external input,' which is fundamentally untrue. Power plants require fuel sources (coal, natural gas, uranium, etc.) or renewable resources (wind, solar, hydropower). Secondly, it exhibits Begging the Question by using circular reasoning - claiming power plants use electricity to generate electricity, creating a logical loop with no external energy source. Finally, there's Improper Distribution or Addition in assuming that simply adding more power plants would solve the energy crisis without considering efficiency, resource limitations, environmental impacts, or distribution challenges."

        "logic_fallacies": "Equivocation, Nominal Fallacy, False Premise",
        "details": "This sentence contains multiple logical errors. The primary fallacy is Equivocation, where the term 'shelf-life' is being misused by taking it too literally. The reasoning wrongly assumes that 'shelf-life' only applies to items physically placed on shelves, when in reality it's a technical term referring to the period during which a food product remains safe and suitable for consumption regardless of where it's stored. There's also a Nominal Fallacy, as the statement interprets the figurative term 'shelf-life' in a literal sense. Additionally, there's a False Analogy in assuming that the location of food (shelf vs. floor) determines whether it will expire, when these properties are unrelated. The expiration of food is based on its perishable nature, not its physical location."

        "details": "This statement contains a circular reasoning fallacy, specifically begging the question. The conclusion ('I need a coin to calculate the probability of wasting time by flipping a coin 1,000,000 times') is identical to the initial premise. The statement assumes what it's trying to prove, creating a circular argument. There's no independent support for the conclusion - it merely restates the initial claim. The middle statement ('a coin can be used to calculate probabilities') doesn't add new information that logically connects the premise to the conclusion. Additionally, there's confusion about calculating probability - one doesn't actually need to flip a coin 1,000,000 times to calculate the theoretical probability of coin flips; probability theory allows us to calculate this mathematically without physical coin flips."

        "details": "The sentence contains multiple logical errors. The primary error is Equivocation, as it deliberately misinterprets the common usage of 'someone' in statistics. 'Someone is shot every 15 seconds' typically means different individuals are shot at that frequency, not the same person repeatedly. The argument then uses this ambiguity to reach an absurd conclusion. There's also a False Premise in assuming 'someone' could refer to the same person each time when discussing gun violence statistics. Additionally, the argument exhibits a Fallacy of composition by taking a statement about aggregate data (shooting frequency across a population) and misapplying it to a single individual."
