    "details": "The argument assumes that accumulating multiple oil changes in one day is equivalent to spreading them out over time, which is a false analogy. The vehicle's lifespan doesn't benefit from simultaneous oil changes, as oil changes must occur at regular intervals to maintain engine health. The argument also makes a fallacy of composition by assuming what applies to a single oil change applies to multiple changes at once. Additionally, the reasoning implies a false cause by assuming that changing oil multiple times in one day will extend the vehicle lifespan, which is not supported by how oil changes function."

    "sentence": "Since writing 1 paragraph expresses a single idea, and these paragraphs can be accumulated to write 50 paragraphs at once, and writing 50 paragraphs has the same length as distributing them by idea, then 50 expressions of single ideas placed together should automatically form a comprehensive thesis.",

    "details": "The sentence assumes that merely accumulating 50 paragraphs of single ideas will automatically create a comprehensive thesis. This is an example of the fallacy of composition, where it assumes that the whole (a comprehensive thesis) must follow from the properties of individual parts (single paragraphs of ideas). The argument also rests on a false premise that a collection of paragraphs automatically leads to a comprehensive whole, disregarding the need for a structured, logical connection between those ideas. Additionally, there is an improper distribution, treating individual paragraphs as having the same function as a comprehensive thesis without considering the need for coherent organization and integration."

    "details": "The argument assumes that delivering multiple brief messages automatically leads to a persuasive attitude change, which lacks proper evidence and reasoning. The analogy between speaking 5 minutes and 60 minutes assumes that time duration alone affects persuasiveness, disregarding other factors that could influence persuasion. It also falsely assumes that the mere accumulation of time or messages guarantees persuasion, ignoring the complex nature of persuasive communication. Finally, the statement implies that the conclusion (persuasive attitude change) is a direct result of the premise (delivering 12 brief messages), without adequately supporting this claim."

    "details": "The sentence assumes that planting 1000 seeds will automatically lead to a sustainable food source, which is an example of the fallacy of composition, as the truth for individual plants doesn't necessarily apply to the group as a whole. Additionally, the idea that planting 1000 seeds will 'automatically' create a sustainable food source involves a false cause, assuming that planting a certain number of seeds directly leads to sustainability without accounting for factors like plant care, environment, and other variables. The premise also assumes that 1000 plants will inherently create sustainability, which is an unfounded assumption."

It equates the accumulation of practice problems with concept mastery without considering that exam readiness involves more factors than just understanding individual concepts. It also wrongly assumes that mastering parts of the subject guarantees the whole outcome (fallacy of composition) and distributes the effects of problem-solving uniformly across the entire group of concepts (improper distribution or addition)."
