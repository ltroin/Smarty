The argument also relies on a false premise, as the flag\u2019s design does not imply anything about the political neutrality of Switzerland.

First, the assumption that 'males should have periods' is a false premise, as males do not have menstrual cycles due to biological differences. The reasoning presented incorrectly assumes that the absence of a period in a male is a cause for concern, leading to a false cause fallacy. Additionally, the statement implies a reversal of biological facts, which could be seen as a wrong direction fallacy, attributing a condition (menstruation) to a gender where it doesn't apply."

While heat can kill germs on food, the body temperature needed to kill germs without causing harm is much lower than the temperatures used in cooking. Additionally, the argument assumes a 'wrong direction' in causality, incorrectly suggesting that cooking yourself will directly kill germs inside the body. The argument also relies on a 'false premise' because it assumes cooking can kill internal germs in the same way it kills germs on food, which is biologically untrue."

It also falsely analogizes tobacco to vegetables, ignoring the overall context and other ingredients involved in cigarette production. Additionally, the assumption that anything made from healthy ingredients must be healthy is an improper distribution or addition, as it fails to account for the complex process of cigarette production, where other harmful factors may still be present. Finally, it commits the accident fallacy by applying a general rule (healthiness of vegetables) to a specific case (cigarettes), ignoring exceptions or the nuanced circumstances of cigarette production."

While the word 'conductor' is used in both contexts, the comparison is flawed because the two uses of the term are unrelated\u2014train conductors are human operators, while superconductors refer to materials with specific physical properties. The premise assumes that because superconductors are better conductors of electricity, they should somehow be responsible for operating trains, which is a false premise. This reasoning also begs the question by assuming that 'superconductors' should logically replace human conductors without further justification or explanation of how this would work practically."

The idea that wearing contact lenses backwards would make you see 'inwards' is also an incorrect attribution of causality, implying that merely reversing the lenses' orientation would produce an entirely different, unverified outcome.

National debt is not directly analogous to a simple mathematical operation, and assuming that a 'positive' national debt leads to profit is a false premise.
